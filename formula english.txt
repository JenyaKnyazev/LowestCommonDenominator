how to find the lowest common denominator 
first we take the reminder of devision from the big number to small
then we divide the small number by the reminder and got number with fractural 
we take the fractural denominator and multiply the number to make it not fractural and then multiply the big number by this number

Example:
20 28
28%20=8
20/8=2.5=2 1/2
because the fractural part the deniminator is 2 we multiply by 2 
2 1/2 *2=5
and finish 5*28=140


Example2:
18 28
28%18=10
18/10=1.8= 1 8/10=1 4/5
1 4/5 *5 = 9
finish 28*9=252



if the first reminder equal 0 so the smallest common denominator is the big number
